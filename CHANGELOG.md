# v2.0.0

## Bug Fixes

- #67 - swagger schema extensions (^x-) in info section are not allowed
- #63 - Incorrect property path on validation errors
- #73 - Validation for multiple $ref parameters doesn't work

## Features

- Use [swagger-parser](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-parser) to validate the Swagger spec.
- The api is dereferenced (both remote and local $ref are dereferenced) using [swagger-parser](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-parser) #40
- Use [JSON schema validator](https://github.com/mafintosh/is-my-json-valid) as the default validator. #30.
- Option to set `joischema` to `true` to use [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) schema validator. Uses [enjoi](https://github.com/tlivings/enjoi) - The json to joi schema converter - to build the validator functions.
- By default, validators are provided for `response` schema also (in addition to input `parameters`).

## Breaking Changes

- Sync to async - `swaggerize-routes` now returns a `promise` that resolves to a [route object](README.md#route-object-response) (Version `1.x` returns `routes` array). The api also has an optional callback function (instead of the promise api).
- The [`validator` object](README.md#validator-object) in the validators array, no longer provides the `schema` property (Version 1.x has the `schema` property, which is the joi schema of the validator). The 2.x version, added a `joischema` property to access the joi schema. Also there is a new `spec` property that provides the json schema (swagger spec) of the parameter/response.
